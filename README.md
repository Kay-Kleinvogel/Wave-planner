# Wave Planner

## Purpose

The purpose of this tool is to create an easy way to generate a wave-based schedule. The problem was that it always took to long, to identify the right dates for the different project waves, so an automated approach was needed.

## Functionality

The functionality of the application is currently rather simple, as we are in the proof of concept stage. All you have to do is to enter your project start date, the number of waves you're planning to have, and the length of each wave (in weeks). Then the tool will create a schedule with the start and end date of each wave.

## Tooling

Frontend: React
Component Library: Material UI

# Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
